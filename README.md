The cattle monitoring system project using geofencing aims to improve the management and monitoring of livestock by leveraging IoT technologies. The system involves tracking the location and health of cattle through wearable devices equipped with sensors, GPS, and geofencing features. The primary objective is to enhance the efficiency of livestock management, reduce the risk of theft, and improve the overall well-being of the animals.
The system is designed to monitor the cattle's location in real-time, allowing farmers to track their livestock's movements and ensure they remain within designated grazing areas. Geofencing technology is used to create virtual boundaries, which can be customized to suit different grazing areas and environmental conditions. When a cow enters or leaves a geofenced area, the system sends alerts to the farmer, enabling them to monitor the cattle's movements and take appropriate actions if necessary.
In addition to location tracking, the system also monitors the health of the cattle by collecting data on vital signs, such as temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. This information can be used to identify potential health issues early and facilitate timely intervention by veterinarians or farmers.
